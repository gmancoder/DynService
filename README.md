# DynService
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Custom API

This site uses WebAPI 2 to interact with my instance of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM platform. The WCF service endpoint that comes with the platform was difficult to use so I implemented my own CRUD service. I interact with this internally using PHP, Python, and C# in other applications and scripts.
